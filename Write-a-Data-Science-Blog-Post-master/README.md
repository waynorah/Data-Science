## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this Udacity Nanodegree project, FIFA 19 complete player dataset is choosn.

Questions are following:

Question 1: Which Nation has most number of Soccer Players collected in FIFA 19, list the top 20 Nations
