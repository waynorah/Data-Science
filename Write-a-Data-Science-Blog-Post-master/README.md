## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I chose FIFA 19 complete player dataset. 

As a football fan,  it would be quite interesting to apply data analysis skills here. 

My key interests would be:

1. What's the ratio of  total wages/ total potential for clubs. Which clubs are the most economical ï¼Ÿ
2. How is nation team player total market value distributed? Probably show a distribution plot in a world map?
3. How is a player's skilsl set influence his potential/wage? Can we predict a player's potential based on his skills' set? 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Data.csv contains lastest edition FIFA 2019 players attributes including age, potential, wage, etc. 

There is also a notebook available here to showcsae all my work related to my three questions.



## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the [post](https://medium.com/@u0509421/fifa-19-complete-player-dataset-what-can-we-tell-from-it-f7343fdad020) available
