## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this Udacity Nanodegree project, FIFA 19 complete player dataset is choosn.

Questions are following:

Question 1: Which Nation has most number of Soccer Players collected in FIFA 19, list the top 20 Nations

Question 2: How about the age distribution of the FIFA 19 Players? How is it related to player's wage?

Question 3: Find out the top 10 clubs with highest total player market value, and the highest average player wage

Question 4: Correlation between Age, Overall, Potential, Position, Club, Nationality, Special vs Value/Wage

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Data.csv contains lastest edition FIFA 2019 players attributes including age, potential, wage, etc. 

There is also a notebook available here to showcsae all my work related to my three questions.



## Results<a name="results"></a>
